# These cycle counts were obtained on the PTARM Simulator v1.0, obtained from
# http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/pret/src/ptarm-1.0/ptarm_simulator.html.
# The basis paths were generated with Z3 v4.3.0 as the backend SMT solver and
# the Gurobi Optimizer v5.1.0 as the backend integer linear programming solver.

# Basis path 1:
# exponent = 0x0;
1   600

# Basis path 2:
# exponent = 0x7;
2   842

# Basis path 3:
# exponent = 0xb;
3   847

# Basis path 4:
# exponent = 0xe;
4   840

# Basis path 5:
# exponent = 0xd;
5   847
