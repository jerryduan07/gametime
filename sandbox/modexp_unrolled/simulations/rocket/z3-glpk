# These cycle counts were obtained on the PTARM Simulator v1.0, obtained from
# http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/pret/src/ptarm-1.0/ptarm_simulator.html.
# The basis paths were generated with Z3 v4.3.0 as the backend SMT solver and
# the GLPK package v1.5.3 as the backend integer linear programming solver.

# Basis path 1:
# exponent = 0x3;
2   753

# Basis path 2:
# exponent = 0x4;
1   708

# Basis path 3:
# exponent = 0x8;
5   723

# Basis path 4:
# exponent = 0xd;
3   856

# Basis path 5:
# exponent = 0xe;
4   839
