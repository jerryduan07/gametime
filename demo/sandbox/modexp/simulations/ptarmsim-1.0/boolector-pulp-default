# These cycle counts were obtained on the PTARM Simulator v1.0, obtained from
# http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/pret/src/ptarm-1.0/ptarm_simulator.html.
# The basis paths were generated with Boolector as the backend SMT solver
# (with Lingeling as its SAT solver) and the default solver of the PuLP
# package (v1.5.3) as the backend integer linear programming solver.

# Basis path 1:
# exponent = 0x9;
1   762

# Basis path 2:
# exponent = 0x2;
2   678

# Basis path 3:
# exponent = 0xe;
3   840

# Basis path 4:
# exponent = 0x7;
4   842

# Basis path 5:
# exponent = 0x4;
5   684
